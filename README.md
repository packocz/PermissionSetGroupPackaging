# Testing behaviour of Permission Set Groups
Particularly interested in removing PS from existing PSG
- Managed package upgrade
- Unlocked package (with/without namespace) upgrade
- Metadata API deployment
  
## Initial State
All packages at version 0.1 (and source package at equivalent commit) have PSGs with 3 permission sets (Custom Object, Custom App and Standard Object).
